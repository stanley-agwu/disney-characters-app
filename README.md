## Usage

The app on load shows an input field for running a search of Disney characters. Upon the type of at least a letter, it queries the API for data relating to the query. The data of Disney characters are displayed on a table.
Upon clicking on an item on the table, it directs to detailed information about the Disney character. The pages are bookmarkable.
